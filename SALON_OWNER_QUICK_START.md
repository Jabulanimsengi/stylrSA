## Managing Bookings

### Viewing Bookings
- Go to Dashboard ‚Üí **Bookings** tab
- Three sub-tabs:
  - **Pending**: New booking requests waiting for your response
  - **Confirmed**: Bookings you've accepted
  - **Past**: Completed or cancelled bookings

### Responding to Bookings
For each pending booking, you can:
- ‚úÖ **Confirm** - Accept the booking (slot becomes unavailable)
- ‚ùå **Decline** - Reject the booking (slot becomes available again)

### Best Practices:
1. **Respond within 24 hours** - Quick responses improve customer satisfaction
2. **Confirm bookings you can fulfill** - Only confirm if you're sure you can provide the service
3. **Decline with reason** - If you decline, consider sending a message explaining why
4. **Mark as "Completed"** - After the appointment, mark it complete to keep records clean

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to load available time slots"
**Cause**: Operating hours not configured
**Solution**: Follow the setup steps above to configure your hours

### Customers Can't See My Slots
**Check**:
1. Are your operating hours saved? (View Dashboard ‚Üí Booking Settings)
2. Is the day marked as "open"?
3. Are you trying to book in the past? (Past times are automatically hidden)

### All Slots Show as "Busy"
**Cause**: Multiple confirmed bookings at those times
**Solution**: Review your confirmed bookings in the Bookings tab

### Want to Block Specific Times?
**Current Limitation**: You can't block specific hours within your operating day yet.
**Workaround**:
1. Accept the booking that would block that time
2. Create a "personal" booking for yourself
3. Or adjust your daily hours temporarily

## Advanced Tips

### Optimizing for Your Service Durations
- If you offer 60-minute services, you'll see hourly slots (9:00, 10:00, 11:00, etc.)
- For 30-minute services, you'll see half-hour slots (9:00, 9:30, 10:00, etc.)
- The system automatically creates slots based on each service's duration

### Managing Multiple Services
- Each service can have different durations
- Slots are calculated per service
- Longer services (e.g., 2-hour hair treatment) will show fewer available slots

### Mobile Service Considerations
- If you offer mobile services, customers can select "Request mobile service"
- Your mobile fee is automatically added to the total
- You still control which booking to accept
