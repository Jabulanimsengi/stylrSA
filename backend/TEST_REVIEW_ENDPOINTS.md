## Test 6: Verify Database Schema Changes

### Test Query:
```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
SELECT

  rating,
  comment,
  "salonOwnerResponse",
  "salonOwnerRespondedAt",
  "approvalStatus"
FROM "Review"
WHERE "salonOwnerResponse" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

### Expected Results:
‚úÖ `salonOwnerResponse` column exists  
‚úÖ `salonOwnerRespondedAt` column exists  
‚úÖ Both columns are nullable (optional)  
‚úÖ Existing reviews have NULL values (backwards compatible)

---

## Test 7: Error Handling Tests

### Test 7a: Non-Owner Tries to Respond
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/{reviewId}/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=DIFFERENT_SALON_OWNER_JWT" \
  -d '{"response": "This should fail"}'
```

**Expected**: ‚ùå 403 Forbidden - "You can only respond to reviews for your own salon."

---

### Test 7b: Try to Respond to Pending Review
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/{pendingReviewId}/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_SALON_OWNER_JWT" \
  -d '{"response": "This should fail"}'
```

**Expected**: ‚ùå 403 Forbidden - "You can only respond to approved reviews."

---

### Test 7c: User Without Salon Tries to Fetch Reviews
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/my-salon-reviews \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=CUSTOMER_JWT_NO_SALON"
```

**Expected**: ‚ùå 404 Not Found - "You do not own a salon."

---

### Test 7d: Empty Response Text
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/{reviewId}/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_SALON_OWNER_JWT" \
  -d '{"response": "   "}'
```

**Expected**: Response is trimmed, should reject if empty after trim

---

## Test 8: End-to-End Notification Flow

### Complete Journey:
1. ‚úÖ Salon owner marks booking COMPLETED
2. ‚úÖ Customer gets notification "Leave a review"
3. ‚úÖ Customer submits 5-star review
4. ‚úÖ Admin gets notification "New review pending"
5. ‚úÖ Admin approves review
6. ‚úÖ Customer gets notification "Review approved"
7. ‚úÖ **Salon owner gets notification "New 5-star review"**
8. ‚úÖ Salon owner responds to review
9. ‚úÖ Customer gets notification "Salon responded"

### Verify Notifications:
```bash
# Check customer notifications
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/notifications \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=CUSTOMER_JWT"

# Check salon owner notifications
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/notifications \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=SALON_OWNER_JWT"

# Check admin notifications
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/notifications \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=ADMIN_JWT"
```

## üîç Quick Verification Checklist

### Database:
- [ ] `Review` table has `salonOwnerResponse` column
- [ ] `Review` table has `salonOwnerRespondedAt` column
- [ ] Existing reviews still work (backwards compatible)

### API Endpoints:
- [ ] `GET /api/reviews/my-salon-reviews` returns grouped reviews
- [ ] `PATCH /api/reviews/:id/respond` updates review with response
- [ ] Both endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Proper authorization checks in place

### Notifications:
- [ ] Booking completion sends "Leave review" notification to customer
- [ ] Review approval sends notification to salon owner (NEW)
- [ ] Review approval sends notification to customer (existing)
- [ ] Salon response sends notification to customer (NEW)

### Business Logic:
- [ ] Only salon owners can fetch their reviews
- [ ] Only salon owners can respond to their reviews
- [ ] Only approved reviews can be responded to
- [ ] Salon avgRating recalculates on approval
- [ ] Reviews grouped correctly (pending/approved/needsResponse)
