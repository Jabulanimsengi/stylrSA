# Fix: Featured Route Returning 404

## The Problem

The error shows:
```
"message": "Salon with ID featured not found"
```

This means `/api/salons/featured` is being treated as `/api/salons/:id` where `id="featured"`.

**Root Cause:** The backend hasn't loaded the new `featured` route yet.

## The Solution: Restart Backend Properly

### Option 1: Clean Restart (Recommended)

1. **Stop the backend** (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)

2. **Delete build artifacts:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   Remove-Item -Path dist -Recurse -Force
   ```

3. **Start backend:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Wait for "Application is running"** message

5. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Option 2: Quick Restart

1. **Stop the backend** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```
3. **Refresh browser**

## Verify It's Fixed

After restart, test the endpoint:

### In PowerShell:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/salons/featured" -UseBasicParsing
```

**Success:** Should return `[]` with status 200
**Failure:** Still returns 404 with "Salon with ID featured not found"

### In Browser:
Go to: http://localhost:5000/api/salons/featured

**Success:** Shows `[]` (empty array)
**Failure:** Shows error about "Salon with ID featured not found"

## Why This Happened

NestJS uses hot-reload during development, but sometimes:
- New routes don't register properly
- Route order changes aren't picked up
- Controller modifications need full restart

The `dist/` folder contains compiled code, and sometimes it gets out of sync with source code.

## After Fix

Once the backend restarts correctly:

1. Homepage should load without "Failed to fetch featured salons" error
2. Go to `/admin` â†’ "Featured Salons" tab
3. Feature a salon
4. Refresh homepage
5. Featured salon should appear in carousel!

**Still seeing 404 after restart?** 

Check if the code is actually there:
```bash
cd backend/src/salons
cat salons.controller.ts | Select-String "featured"
```

Should show the route definition.
