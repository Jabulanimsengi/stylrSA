## 1. üìß Email Verification Setup (CRITICAL)

### Current Status: ‚è≥ **Awaiting Domain Verification**

### Steps to Complete:

#### Step 1: Go to Resend Dashboard
1. Visit: https://resend.com/domains
2. Log in with your Resend account

#### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. Click **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter: `stylrsa.co.za`
3. Click **"Add Domain"**

#### Step 3: Configure DNS Records
Resend will provide you with DNS records to add. You'll need to add these to your domain provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare).

**Typical records:**

```
Type: TXT
Name: _resend
Value: [provided by Resend]

Type: CNAME  
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]
```

#### Step 4: Add DNS Records to Your Domain Provider
1. Log in to your domain provider (where you registered stylrsa.co.za)
2. Go to DNS settings
3. Add the TXT and CNAME records exactly as shown in Resend
4. Save changes

#### Step 5: Wait for Verification
- Usually takes **5-15 minutes**
- Resend will automatically verify once DNS propagates
- Refresh the Resend dashboard to check status

#### Step 6: Confirm Verification
- Domain should show **"Verified"** status with a green checkmark ‚úÖ
- Once verified, emails will be sent from `info@stylrsa.co.za`

### Testing Email Verification:

```bash
# 1. Start backend server
cd backend
npm run start:dev

# 2. Start frontend server (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# 3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# 4. Register a new account
# 5. Check email inbox for verification code
# 6. Enter code and verify it works
```

### If Emails Not Received:
1. Check **spam/junk folder**
2. Verify domain is **"Verified"** in Resend
3. Check backend console for errors
4. Verify `FROM_EMAIL=info@stylrsa.co.za` in `backend/.env`

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: What if I don't set up Resend domain verification?
**A:** Email verification will fail. Users won't receive verification codes and won't be able to complete registration.

**Solution:** Follow Step 1 above to verify your domain.

### Q: What if I don't set up Vimeo?
**A:** Video uploads will fail. The video feature won't work at all.

**Solution:** Follow Step 2 above to get a Vimeo access token.

### Q: Can I test locally without domain verification?
**A:** For emails, Resend will still send emails to the console in development, but they won't be delivered to real email addresses. For production, domain verification is **required**.

### Q: How much will Vimeo cost after the free trial?
**A:** $15/month for the Standard plan (250GB storage/year). You can stay on free tier if storage is sufficient.

### Q: Can I use a different video hosting service?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to modify the `VimeoService` to integrate with a different provider (e.g., Cloudflare Stream, Mux, AWS S3).
