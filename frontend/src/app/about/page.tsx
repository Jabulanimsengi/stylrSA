        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Our Mission</h2>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          At Stylr SA, our mission is to digitally revolutionize the beauty and wellness industry in South Africa. We connect talented professionals and business owners with new clients, and help South Africans discover and book services with confidence, ease, and complete peace of mind.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Our Story</h2>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          Stylr SA was born from a simple, shared frustration: finding a trusted, local beauty professional was fragmented and difficult. We wanted to find the best braider in our neighborhood, a last-minute nail technician for an event, or a massage therapist with verified reviews, all in one place.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          We envisioned a single platform that not only makes discovery and booking seamless for customers but also provides a powerful, all-in-one management tool for salon owners and independent entrepreneurs. We built Stylr SA to be that solutionâ€”an ecosystem that empowers local businesses to grow and helps clients to look and feel their best.
