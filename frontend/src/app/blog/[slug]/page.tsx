    title: 'The 2024/2025 Guide to Protective Hairstyles: Top Braids & Twists in South Africa',
    description: 'Welcome to the ultimate guide for protective styling! In South Africa, a protective style is more than just a beautiful look—it\'s an essential part of hair care, protecting our natural hair from the elements, promoting growth, and giving us a break from daily styling. But with so many options, how do you choose? We\'re breaking down the most popular styles, from classic box braids to the trendy knotless twists, and helping you find the perfect specialist for the job.',

        heading: 'Knotless Braids: The "No-Pain" Sensation',
        content: 'Unlike traditional box braids that start with a knot at the scalp, knotless braids begin with your natural hair and gradually feed in the braiding hair. This method puts significantly less tension on your scalp, reducing the risk of traction alopecia and breakage. They are more flexible from day one (you can pull them into a high bun immediately!) and have a more natural-looking, flatter lay. Best for: Anyone with a sensitive scalp or those looking to give their edges a rest. Where to find them: This is a specialist skill. Look for stylists in Johannesburg or Cape Town who specifically list "Knotless Braids" in their services.'

        heading: 'Box Braids: The Timeless Classic',
        content: 'The iconic style that has been a staple for decades. Hair is sectioned into squares (or "boxes") and braided from the root with extension hair. They are incredibly versatile, long-lasting (4-8 weeks), and can be customized in any size or length, from a chic bob to waist-length. Best for: Anyone looking for a reliable, long-lasting, and stylish look. Pro-Tip: Check a stylist\'s gallery for clean parts and consistent braid size.'

They offer a beautiful, bohemian vibe that\'s lightweight and full of volume. They are generally faster to install than braids. Best for: Holidays, special events, or anyone wanting a soft, romantic look.'

        heading: 'Cornrows & Feed-In Styles',
        content: 'Braids done flat against the scalp. "Feed-in" styles are the modern approach, where braiding hair is added gradually to create a natural-looking cornrow that starts thin and gets thicker. They are the foundation for many other styles (like wigs or crochet) but are a stunning style on their own. Intricate patterns, from simple straight-backs to complex artistic designs, are a true art form. Best for: A stylish, low-maintenance look for 1-2 weeks.'

A light peel (like a Lactic Acid peel) can slough off the top layer of dead, dry skin, allowing your hydrating products to penetrate deeper.
