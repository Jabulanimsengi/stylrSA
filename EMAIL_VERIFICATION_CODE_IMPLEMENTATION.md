# Email Verification Code Implementation

## Overview
Implemented OTP (One-Time Password) code-based email verification system with enforcement for new users only. Old users and Google OAuth users are unaffected.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. auth.service.ts
**New Features:**
- `VERIFICATION_ENFORCEMENT_DATE` constant (set to 2025-10-21)
- `generateVerificationCode()` method - generates 6-digit codes
- Updated verification token from UUID to 6-digit numeric code
- Reduced verification expiry from 24 hours to 15 minutes (more secure)
- **Login enforcement:** New users created after cutoff date must verify email before login

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
// Only enforce verification for:
// 1. Users created after Oct 21, 2025
// 2. Users who are not verified
// 3. Manual signups (not OAuth)
const isNewUser = user.createdAt >= this.VERIFICATION_ENFORCEMENT_DATE;
const isManualSignup = !user.oauthAccounts || user.oauthAccounts.length === 0;

if (isNewUser && !user.emailVerified && isManualSignup) {
  throw new UnauthorizedException('Please verify your email...');
}
```

#### 2. mail.service.ts
**Updated Email Template:**
- Large, prominent verification code display
- Gradient styled code box
- Clear instructions to enter code in app
- 15-minute expiry notice
- No more links - code-based only

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. VerifyEmailCode.tsx (New Component)
**Features:**
- 6-digit code input with individual boxes
- Auto-focus and auto-advance between inputs
- Paste support (users can paste entire 6-digit code)
- Built-in resend functionality
- Mobile responsive
- Beautiful gradient styling matching brand colors

#### 2. Register.tsx
**Updated Flow:**
- Shows verification code input immediately after registration
- No page navigation needed
- Seamless in-modal experience
- Cancel option to return to registration

#### 3. Login.tsx
**New Verification Handling:**
- Detects "verify your email" error
- Automatically sends verification code
- Shows VerifyEmailCode component
- Auto-logs in after successful verification
- Smooth UX with no page reloads

#### 4. ResendVerification.tsx
**Updated:**
- Sends codes instead of links
- Shows verification input after code is sent
- Integrated with new code system

## User Experience Flow

### Registration Flow
```
1. User fills registration form
2. Submits → Success message
3. Email sent with 6-digit code (e.g., 487293)
4. Verification input appears in modal
5. User enters code from email
6. Account verified → Redirected based on role
```

### Unverified Login Flow (New Users)
```
1. User tries to log in without verifying
2. Error: "Please verify your email..."
3. Verification code automatically sent
4. VerifyEmailCode component shown
5. User enters code
6. Account verified → Automatically logged in
```

### Old Users Flow
```
1. User logs in (created before Oct 21, 2025)
2. No verification check performed
3. Logs in successfully
4. No disruption to existing accounts
```

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Existing Accounts Safe
- **Verified accounts:** Continue working normally
- **Old unverified accounts (created before Oct 21, 2025):**
  - Can log in without verification
  - Old UUID verification tokens still work if they have them
  - If they resend verification, they get new 6-digit codes

### ✅ Google OAuth Users
- Marked as `emailVerified: true` on creation
- Skip all verification flows
- No changes to their experience

### ✅ Database Compatibility
- No schema changes required
- `verificationToken` field accepts both UUIDs and 6-digit codes
- Verification endpoint validates any string token

## Security Improvements

1. **Shorter Expiry:** 15 minutes instead of 24 hours
2. **Numeric Codes:** Easier to type, harder to misread
3. **No Link Vulnerabilities:** No URL parsing issues
4. **Rate Limiting:** Already in place via Throttle decorators
5. **Selective Enforcement:** Only new accounts, minimizes disruption

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Restart backend with `.\FORCE_RESTART.ps1`
- [ ] Test registration → receives 6-digit code email
- [ ] Test code verification endpoint
- [ ] Test code expiry (15 minutes)
- [ ] Test resend code functionality

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Register new account → see verification input
- [ ] Enter valid code → account verified
- [ ] Enter invalid code → error shown
- [ ] Resend code → new code sent
- [ ] Paste 6-digit code → all boxes filled

### Login Tests
- [ ] **Old user (created before Oct 21):** Can log in without verification
- [ ] **New user (unverified):** Blocked, shown verification input
- [ ] **New user (verified):** Can log in normally
- [ ] **Google OAuth user:** Can log in (always verified)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Old user resends verification → gets new code, can use it
- [ ] User with expired code → can resend
- [ ] Multiple resend attempts → all work (rate limited)
- [ ] Code verification after login attempt → auto-logs in

## Environment Configuration

No environment variables needed. The cutoff date is hardcoded in `auth.service.ts`:

```typescript
private readonly VERIFICATION_ENFORCEMENT_DATE = new Date('2025-10-21T00:00:00Z');
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Deploy Order:** Backend first, then frontend (avoid mismatch)
2. **Zero Downtime:** All changes are backward compatible
3. **No Database Migration:** Uses existing schema
4. **Monitoring:** Watch for verification-related errors in logs

## Support Considerations

### User Questions
- "I didn't receive a code" → Check spam folder, resend option available
- "My code expired" → Resend option provided
- "I'm an old user, do I need to verify?" → No, you can log in directly

### Admin Actions
- Can manually verify users by setting `emailVerified: true`
- Can check `createdAt` to determine if enforcement applies
- Can adjust `VERIFICATION_ENFORCEMENT_DATE` if needed

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add SMS verification option
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per email (not just per endpoint)
- [ ] Add verification status indicator in user profile
- [ ] Analytics on verification completion rates
- [ ] Remind unverified users periodically

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Remove verification check from login (comment out lines in `auth.service.ts`)
2. Users can still verify if they want
3. System reverts to pre-enforcement behavior
4. No data loss or corruption risk
