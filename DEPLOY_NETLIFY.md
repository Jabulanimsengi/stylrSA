# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Netlify

This guide outlines the steps to deploy the **Stylr SA** frontend to Netlify.

## 1. Prerequisites
- [x] **Netlify Account**: Create one at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).
- [x] **Git Repository**: Your code must be pushed to GitHub/GitLab.

## 2. Netlify Setup

1.  Log in to the **Netlify Dashboard**.
2.  Click **"Add new site"** > **"Import from an existing project"**.
3.  Select **GitHub** (or your Git provider).
4.  Pick your repository (`hairprosdirectory` or `thesalonhub-monorepo`).

## 3. Build Configuration

Netlify should detect the settings automatically from the `netlify.toml` file I created. Verify them:

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base directory** | `frontend` |
| **Build command** | `npm run build` |
| **Publish directory** | `.next` |

## 4. Environment Variables

Go to **Site configuration > Environment variables** and add these:

| Variable | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://www.stylrsa.co.za` (or your Netlify URL) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://stylrsa.onrender.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN` | `https://stylrsa.onrender.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE` | `false` (Set to false or remove it) |

> **Note**: You do NOT need `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE` anymore.

## 5. Deploy

1.  Click **Deploy**.
2.  Netlify will build your site. It usually takes 2-3 minutes.

## 6. Verification

1.  Visit the deployed URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`).
2.  Check that the homepage loads.
3.  Check a service page (e.g., `/braids/gauteng/johannesburg`) to ensure the backend connection works.
