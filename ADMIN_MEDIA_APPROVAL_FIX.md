# Admin Media Approval System - Bug Fixes & Design Updates

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Embedding Issue
**Problem:** Videos were stored with URLs in format `https://vimeo.com/{id}` which cannot be embedded in iframes. This prevented videos from displaying properly in the admin review interface.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `VimeoService` to return embeddable player URLs: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/{id}`
- Updated `AdminMediaReview` component to handle both old and new URL formats gracefully
- Created migration script to update existing video records in the database

### 2. Design Inconsistency
**Problem:** The admin media review interface did not match the application's purple color theme.

**Solution:**
- Updated card hover effects to use purple shadow and border: `rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.25)`
- Maintained consistency with the existing purple gradient used in approve buttons
- Enhanced visual feedback with purple-themed hover states

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. **`backend/src/videos/vimeo.service.ts`**
   - Changed video URL format from `https://vimeo.com/${videoId}` to `https://player.vimeo.com/video/${videoId}`
   - This ensures all new video uploads use the embeddable format

### Frontend
2. **`frontend/src/components/AdminMediaReview.tsx`**
   - Added `vimeoId` to ServiceVideo interface
   - Updated video rendering to use embeddable URLs
   - Added fallback logic to convert old URL format to new format using vimeoId
   - Fixed JSX syntax issues with map function closures
   - Improved error handling for video display

3. **`frontend/src/components/AdminMediaReview.module.css`**
   - Updated `.card:hover` to use purple-themed shadow: `0 8px 20px rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.25)`
   - Added purple border on hover: `border-color: rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.3)`
   - Added transparent border to default state for smooth transitions

4. **`frontend/src/components/AdminMediaReview.module.css`** (Color Updates)
   - Updated active tabs to use pink gradient
   - Updated card hover effects to use pink shadow and border
   - Updated service labels to use pink color
   - Updated approve buttons to use pink gradient
   - Updated textarea focus border to pink

### Database Migration
4. **`backend/scripts/migrate-video-urls.ts`**
   - Created migration script to update existing video URLs
   - Converts old format URLs to new embeddable format
   - Successfully ran with 0 videos needing migration (no existing videos or already migrated)

## Testing the Fix

### Prerequisites
1. Restart the backend server to apply Vimeo service changes:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   # Stop current backend process (PID 16052)
   Stop-Process -Id 16052
   # Start backend again
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Test Steps

#### For Before/After Photos:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the admin panel
3. Click on "Before/After Photos" tab
4. You should see pending photos with:
   - Side-by-side before/after images
   - Purple-themed card hover effects
   - Approve/Reject buttons
5. Click "Approve" on a photo
   - Should see success toast notification
   - Photo should disappear from pending list
   - Salon owner should receive notification

#### For Videos:
1. Stay in admin panel
2. Click on "Videos" tab
3. You should see pending videos with:
   - Properly embedded Vimeo videos (playing inline)
   - Purple-themed card hover effects
   - Approve/Reject buttons
4. Click "Approve" on a video
   - Should see success toast notification
   - Video should disappear from pending list
   - Salon owner should receive notification

#### Test Rejection Flow:
1. Click "Reject" button on any media
2. Should see textarea for rejection reason
3. Enter a reason and click "Confirm Reject"
4. Media should be marked as rejected
5. Salon owner should receive notification with reason

## Design Colors Reference

The application uses a consistent **pink color scheme**:

- **Primary Pink Gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #F51957 0%, #d4144c 100%)`
- **Pink Shadow (hover)**: `rgba(245, 25, 87, 0.25)`
- **Pink Border (hover)**: `rgba(245, 25, 87, 0.3)`
- **Main Pink**: `#F51957`
- **Dark Pink**: `#d4144c`
- **Dark Mode Pink**: `#ff3366`
- **Dark Mode Pink Hover**: `#ff5577`
- **Before/After Background**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #fef5f8 0%, #fff8fb 100%)`

These colors are used consistently in:
- Admin panel (tabs, buttons, cards)
- Before/After slideshow (nav buttons, indicators, salon names)
- Video slideshow (play buttons, nav buttons, indicators, salon names)
- All hover states and active elements

## API Endpoints (Reference)

All endpoints are working correctly:

### Before/After Photos
- `GET /api/admin/before-after/pending` - Get pending photos
- `PATCH /api/admin/before-after/:id/approve` - Approve photo
- `PATCH /api/admin/before-after/:id/reject` - Reject photo

### Videos
- `GET /api/admin/videos/pending` - Get pending videos
- `PATCH /api/admin/videos/:id/approve` - Approve video
- `PATCH /api/admin/videos/:id/reject` - Reject video

## Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The frontend now handles both old and new URL formats, so existing videos will continue to work even before database migration.

2. **New Uploads**: All new video uploads will automatically use the correct embeddable format.

3. **Notifications**: Both approval and rejection actions trigger notifications to salon owners with appropriate messages.

4. **Admin Authorization**: All endpoints are protected with admin role guards to ensure only admins can approve/reject media.

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
1. Bulk approval/rejection functionality
2. Filtering by salon or date range
3. Search functionality for pending media
4. Preview zoom functionality for before/after images
5. Video playback controls (pause, volume, fullscreen)
