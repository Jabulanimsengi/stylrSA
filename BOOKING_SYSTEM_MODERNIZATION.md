# Booking System Modernization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Completely modernized the booking system with real-time availability tracking, visual time slot selection, and automatic booking conflict prevention. Also updated the entire application UI to use a clean white background with subtle elevated surfaces.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### New API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/bookings/availability/:serviceId?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Purpose**: Fetch available time slots for a specific service on a given date
- **Public Access**: No authentication required (allows users to check availability before logging in)

#### Availability Calculation Logic
**File**: `backend/src/bookings/bookings.service.ts`

The system now intelligently calculates available time slots based on:

1. **Salon Operating Hours**
   - Checks if salon operates on the selected day
   - Retrieves opening and closing times from salon settings
   - Generates slots only within operating hours

2. **Service Duration**
   - Creates time slots matching service duration (e.g., 60-min service = hourly slots)
   - Ensures slot end time doesn't exceed closing time

3. **Existing Bookings**
   - Fetches all PENDING and CONFIRMED bookings for the date
   - Checks for time slot conflicts/overlaps
   - Marks conflicting slots as "busy"

4. **Past Time Prevention**
   - Automatically marks past time slots as "unavailable"
   - Prevents booking in the past

#### Slot Status Types
- **`available`** (Green): Slot is free and can be booked
- **`busy`** (Yellow): Slot is already booked (PENDING or CONFIRMED)
- **`unavailable`** (Gray): Slot is in the past or salon is closed

#### Booking Validation
- Enhanced `create()` method validates slot availability before creating booking
- Prevents double-bookings with server-side validation
- Returns `BadRequestException` if slot is unavailable

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/bookings/bookings.service.ts` - Added availability logic and validation
- `backend/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` - Added availability endpoint

### 2. Frontend UI Modernization

#### New TimeSlotPicker Component
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/TimeSlotPicker/`

A modern, visual time slot picker with:

**Features:**
- Real-time availability fetching based on selected date
- Color-coded slots (green/yellow/gray) with icons
- Interactive slot selection with hover effects
- Responsive grid layout (2-5 columns based on screen size)
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state messaging
- Visual legend explaining color codes

**User Experience:**
1. User selects a date in the calendar
2. Component automatically fetches available slots for that date
3. User sees visual grid of all possible time slots
4. Only available (green) slots are clickable
5. Selected slot is highlighted with bold styling
6. Busy/unavailable slots are clearly disabled

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/components/TimeSlotPicker/TimeSlotPicker.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/TimeSlotPicker/TimeSlotPicker.module.css`

#### Enhanced BookingModal
**File**: `frontend/src/components/BookingModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced basic date/time picker with inline calendar + time slot picker
- Added calendar icon to date selection label
- Improved layout with wider modal (48rem max-width)
- Auto-resets selected slot when date changes
- Enhanced validation messages
- Better visual hierarchy with separated sections

**User Flow:**
1. Opens booking modal from service card
2. Sees inline calendar to select date
3. After selecting date, time slots automatically load below
4. Selects available time slot (green)
5. Enters phone number and mobile service preference
6. Submits booking request

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/BookingModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/BookingModal.module.css`

### 3. UI Design System Updates

#### White Background Implementation
**File**: `frontend/src/app/globals.css`

Updated CSS variables for a modern, clean white aesthetic:

```css
/* Before */
--color-surface: #f9f6f1;          /* Warm beige */
--color-surface-subtle: #f3ece3;    /* Light beige */
--color-surface-elevated: #fffaf5;  /* Off-white */
--color-border: #cdbfb3;            /* Tan border */
--color-border-strong: #a8968a;     /* Brown border */

/* After */
--color-surface: #ffffff;           /* Pure white */
--color-surface-subtle: #f8f8f8;    /* Very light gray */
--color-surface-elevated: #fafafa;  /* Subtle gray for cards */
--color-border: #e5e5e5;            /* Light gray border */
--color-border-strong: #d4d4d4;     /* Medium gray border */
```

**Impact:**
- Main page background is now pure white (`#ffffff`)
- Cards, modals, and elevated surfaces use subtle gray (`#fafafa`)
- Borders are lighter and more refined
- Better contrast and modern appearance
- Cards stand out with subtle shadows and light backgrounds

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

#### Availability Algorithm
```typescript
// Pseudocode
1. Validate service exists
2. Get salon operating hours for requested day
3. Create time range (open → close)
4. Generate slots based on service duration
5. Fetch existing bookings for that day
6. For each slot:
   - Check if past time → mark unavailable
   - Check if conflicts with booking → mark busy
   - Otherwise → mark available
7. Return slot array with status
```

#### Booking Validation
```typescript
// When creating booking:
1. Fetch availability for that date
2. Find the requested time slot
3. Verify slot.available === true
4. If not available → reject with BadRequestException
5. If available → create booking
```

### Frontend State Management

#### BookingModal State
```typescript
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | null>(null);
const [selectedSlot, setSelectedSlot] = useState<string | null>(null);

// When date changes, reset slot selection
onChange={(date) => {
  setSelectedDate(date);
  setSelectedSlot(null); // Force user to pick new slot
}}
```

#### TimeSlotPicker Lifecycle
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedDate && serviceId) {
    fetchAvailability();
  }
}, [selectedDate, serviceId]);
```

## Operating Hours Management

### Dashboard Integration

Added comprehensive Operating Hours management to the **Booking Settings** tab in the salon dashboard:

**Features:**
- Visual display of configured operating hours
- Edit/View mode toggle
- Bulk actions (apply hours to all days, mark all open/closed)
- Individual day configuration
- Warning message when no hours are set
- Automatic validation

**How Salon Owners Set Hours:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard → **Booking Settings** tab
2. Scroll to "Operating Hours" section
3. Click "Edit Hours" (or it opens automatically if no hours set)
4. Configure each day:
   - Check/uncheck days to mark as open/closed
   - Set opening and closing times for each day
   - Use "Apply to all" feature for consistent hours
5. Click "Save Hours"
6. System confirms and updates availability calendar

**Warning System:**
- Red warning box appears if no operating hours are configured
- Explains that customers won't see booking slots until hours are set
- Success message confirms when hours are saved

### Backend Compatibility

The backend now handles **both array and object formats** for operating hours:

**Array Format** (from frontend):
```json
[
  { "day": "Monday", "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00" },
  { "day": "Tuesday", "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00" }
]
```

**Object Format** (legacy/alternative):
```json
{
  "Monday": { "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00" },
  "Tuesday": { "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00" }
}
```

The availability endpoint automatically detects and parses both formats, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. The booking system uses existing configurations.

### Database
No database migrations required. Uses existing Prisma schema.

### Testing Before Deploy
1. Test with various salon operating hours configurations
2. Test with different service durations (30min, 60min, 90min, etc.)
3. Test with salons that have irregular hours
4. Test concurrent booking attempts
5. Verify mobile responsiveness

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the system can fall back to the previous date/time picker by:
1. Reverting `BookingModal.tsx` changes
2. Backend availability endpoint is backward compatible (no changes needed to existing booking flow)

---

## Support Information

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Slots not loading
**Solution**: Check browser console for API errors. Verify service ID and date format.

**Issue**: All slots show as unavailable
**Solution**: Verify salon has operating hours configured for that day of the week.

**Issue**: Can book conflicting times
**Solution**: Ensure backend booking validation is running (server-side protection).

### Debug Mode
Add to browser console to see availability data:
```javascript
// In TimeSlotPicker component, add:
console.log('Slots loaded:', slots);
```
