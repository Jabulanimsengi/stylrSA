# üîÑ RESTART BACKEND TO APPLY CHANGES

## Why You're Seeing "Something went wrong"

Your backend server is still running the OLD code from before we made the changes. NestJS watches for file changes but sometimes needs a full restart.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Restart Backend Server (Recommended)

1. **Find the terminal running your backend** (look for process with `nest start --watch`)

2. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl + C`

3. **Start it again**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Watch for these log messages**:
   - `MailModule dependencies initialized`
   - `AuthModule dependencies initialized`
   - `Nest application successfully started`

### Option 2: Kill All Node Processes and Restart

If Ctrl+C doesn't work:

```powershell
# Kill all node processes
Stop-Process -Name "node" -Force

# Then start backend again
cd C:\Users\ramos\all_coding\hairprosdirectory\backend
npm run start:dev
```

## ‚úÖ After Restart - Test These Scenarios

### Test 1: New User Registration
- Try registering with a NEW email
- You should see in backend console:
  ```
  [EMAIL] Attempting to send verification email to...
  [EMAIL] Verification email sent successfully...
  ```
- Frontend should show: "Registration successful! Please check your email..."

### Test 2: Existing Unverified User
- Try registering again with the SAME email (that was never verified)
- Frontend should show: "Account already exists but not verified. Verification email has been resent."
- Email should be sent automatically

### Test 3: Existing Verified User
- Try registering with an email that's already verified
- Frontend should show: "Email already registered. Please log in."

## üêõ If Still Not Working

Check browser console (F12) for errors:
- Look for network errors
- Check the response from `/api/auth/register`

Check backend console for errors:
- Look for `[AUTH]` or `[EMAIL]` logs
- Check for stack traces

## üìù What We Changed

1. **Backend (`auth.service.ts`)**:
   - Added logic to check if user exists before creating
   - If exists but not verified ‚Üí resend email automatically
   - Better error messages

2. **Frontend (`Register.tsx`)**:
   - Now displays actual backend messages
   - Better error handling

3. **Email Config (`.env`)**:
   - Changed FROM_EMAIL to `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's default domain)

4. **New Features**:
   - ResendVerification component
   - "Resend Email" link on login page
