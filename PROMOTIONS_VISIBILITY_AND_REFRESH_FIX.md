## Issue #1: Approved Promotions Not Showing After Admin Approval

### **Problem**
When an admin approved a promotion, it wasn't immediately visible on the `/promotions` page. Users had to do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to see newly approved promotions.

### **Root Causes**

1. **Browser Caching**: The browser was caching the API response
2. **No Cache Busting**: The fetch request didn't prevent caching
3. **No Manual Refresh Option**: Users couldn't manually refresh to see new promotions

### **Solutions Applied**

#### **A. Added Cache Busting to Fetch Request**
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await fetch('/api/promotions/public');

// After:
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
const response = await fetch(`/api/promotions/public?t=${timestamp}`, {
  cache: 'no-store',
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  },
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Timestamp query parameter prevents browser from using cached response
- `cache: 'no-store'` tells browser not to cache this request
- `Cache-Control: no-cache` header forces fresh data

#### **B. Added Refresh Button**

**Visual Design**:
- Icon: Rotating arrows (refresh icon)
- Location: Right side of filter buttons
- Style: Pink border, white background (inverts on hover)
- Animation: Icon spins while loading

**Features**:
- Click to manually refresh promotions
- Icon spins during loading
- Button disabled while fetching
- Tooltip: "Refresh promotions"

**How It Looks**:
```
[All Promotions] [Services] [Products]  |  [🔄 Refresh]
```

## Issue #2: Subtitle Text Invisible

### **Problem**
The subtitle "Discover amazing deals on services and products" was not visible because its text color matched the background color.

### **Root Cause**
The CSS had:
```css
.subtitle {
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  opacity: 0.95; /* ❌ Inherited color might not be visible */
}
```

The subtitle was inside a gradient header but wasn't explicitly set to white, causing visibility issues depending on theme or CSS variable values.

### **Solution Applied**

**Explicit White Color**:
```css
.subtitle {
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  color: white; /* ✅ Explicitly white */
  opacity: 1; /* ✅ Full opacity */
}
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Subtitle is now always white and fully visible
- ✅ Contrasts perfectly against the pink gradient background
- ✅ Works in both light and dark modes

## How to Use the Refresh Button

### **For Users**
1. Visit `/promotions` page
2. Click the "Refresh" button (top right area)
3. Icon spins while fetching
4. Page updates with latest approved promotions

### **When to Use It**
- After admin approves a promotion
- When checking for new deals
- If page seems outdated
- No need for hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) anymore

## Technical Details

### **Cache Busting Strategy**

**Why Timestamp?**
- Simple and effective
- Each request is unique: `/api/promotions/public?t=1234567890`
- No server-side changes needed
- Works with all browsers

**Why Multiple Headers?**
- `cache: 'no-store'` → Fetch API instruction
- `Cache-Control: no-cache` → HTTP header for server/proxy
- Timestamp → Unique URL for browser cache

**Combined Effect**: Triple protection against caching

### **Refresh Button Animation**

**CSS Keyframe Animation**:
```css
@keyframes spin {
  from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

.spinning {
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}
```

**Applied When**:
- `isLoading` state is true
- Icon rotates smoothly
- Visual feedback for user
