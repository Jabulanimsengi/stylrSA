# Operating Hours Solution - Summary

## Problem Identified
Salon owners had no way to indicate when they're **CLOSED** on specific days. The forms only allowed setting open/close times, so salons that don't operate on Sundays (or any other day) couldn't properly represent their schedule.

## Solution Implemented

### Created Reusable Component
Built a professional `OperatingHoursInput` component that both the Create Salon and Edit Salon forms can use.

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/OperatingHoursInput.tsx` - Main component (190 lines)
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/OperatingHoursInput.module.css` - Styling (160 lines)
- ✅ `OPERATING_HOURS_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step integration guide

### Key Features

#### 1. Open/Closed Toggle
Each day now has a **checkbox** to mark it as open or closed:
- ✅ Checked = Salon is open that day (shows time inputs)
- ⬜ Unchecked = Salon is closed that day (shows "Closed" label)

#### 2. Visual Design
- **Open days**: White background, time inputs visible
- **Closed days**: Gray background, dashed border, "Closed" text
- **Hover effects**: Border highlights when hovering over each day

#### 3. Bulk Actions
Two convenience buttons for quick setup:
- **"Mark all as open"**: Opens all days at once
- **"Mark all as closed"**: Closes all days (useful for vacations/holidays)

#### 4. "Apply to all" Feature
Sets the same hours for ALL open days:
- Select open time (e.g., 09:00)
- Select close time (e.g., 17:00)
- Both times apply to all days that are marked as open
- Closed days are not affected

#### 5. Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Horizontal layout, all controls in one row
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing for medium screens
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout, larger touch targets

### Helper Functions

Three utility functions for data handling:

1. **`initializeOperatingHours()`**
   - Creates default state (9 AM - 5 PM, all days open)
   - Used when creating new salons

2. **`parseOperatingHours(rawHours)`**
   - Converts API response to component format
   - Handles both array and object formats
   - Used when loading existing salon data

3. **`serializeOperatingHours(hours)`**
   - Converts component format back to API format
   - Only includes open days in the payload
   - Used when submitting forms

## How to Use (Integration)

The `OPERATING_HOURS_FIX_GUIDE.md` file contains detailed step-by-step instructions for integrating the component into:
1. Create Salon form (`frontend/src/app/create-salon/page.tsx`)
2. Edit Salon modal (`frontend/src/components/EditSalonModal.tsx`)

**TL;DR**: Replace the existing operating hours sections with:
```jsx
<OperatingHoursInput hours={hours} onChange={setHours} />
```

## Example Use Cases

### Salon Closed on Sundays
1. When creating/editing salon
2. Uncheck "Sunday" checkbox
3. Sunday shows "Closed" with gray background
4. Only Mon-Sat hours are saved

### Different Hours for Weekdays/Weekends
1. Use "Apply to all" to set weekday hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
2. Manually adjust Saturday (9 AM - 3 PM)
3. Uncheck Sunday (closed)
4. Each day saves independently

### Vacation/Temporary Closure
1. Click "Mark all as closed" button
2. All days instantly marked as closed
3. Reopen individually or use "Mark all as open" later

## Backend Compatibility

The component is **fully compatible** with the existing backend:
- Sends empty strings for closed days
- Only includes open days in `operatingDays` array
- Backend already handles this format correctly
- **No backend changes needed**

## Before & After

### Before (Current Issue)
```
Monday:    [09:00] to [17:00]
Tuesday:   [09:00] to [17:00]
Wednesday: [09:00] to [17:00]
Thursday:  [09:00] to [17:00]
Friday:    [09:00] to [17:00]
Saturday:  [09:00] to [17:00]
Sunday:    [09:00] to [17:00]  ❌ Can't mark as closed
```

### After (New Component)
```
☑ Monday:    [09:00] to [17:00]
☑ Tuesday:   [09:00] to [17:00]
☑ Wednesday: [09:00] to [17:00]
☑ Thursday:  [09:00] to [17:00]
☑ Friday:    [09:00] to [17:00]
☑ Saturday:  [10:00] to [15:00]
☐ Sunday:    Closed  ✅ Can mark as closed!
```

## Testing Checklist

After integration:

- [ ] Create new salon with Sunday closed
- [ ] Create salon with all days open
- [ ] Edit existing salon to close a day
- [ ] Edit existing salon to change hours only
- [ ] Use "Apply to all" feature
- [ ] Use "Mark all as open/closed" buttons
- [ ] View salon profile - verify hours display correctly
- [ ] Test on mobile (320px, 375px width)
- [ ] Test on tablet (768px, 1024px width)
- [ ] Test on desktop (1920px width)

## Benefits
