# Before & After Photos / Videos Fix + Toast Notification Enhancement

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Before & After Photos / Videos Loading Error
**Problem:** "Failed to load photos" and "Failed to load videos" errors when clicking on these features.

**Root Cause:** Multiple issues prevented the backend from starting:
1. Prisma client needed to be regenerated after new models were added
2. TypeScript compilation errors in controllers and services
3. Missing `uploadImage` method in CloudinaryService
4. CloudinaryService not exported from CloudinaryModule
5. Incorrect import paths for JwtGuard

**Solution:**
- Fixed import paths: Changed `'../auth/guard'` to `'../auth/guard/jwt.guard'`
- Added `uploadImage` and `uploadVideo` methods to CloudinaryService
- Installed `streamifier` package for handling file uploads
- Fixed Vimeo service type errors
- Added `exports: [CloudinaryService]` to CloudinaryModule
- Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- Enhanced error handling in components to show specific error messages

### 2. ✅ Toast Notification Close Button Not Clickable
**Problem:** The X button on toast notifications was not clickable or hard to click.

**Solution:** Enhanced the close button styling in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`:
- Increased button size from 20px to 28px for better touch targets
- Added visible background (semi-transparent) to make button more noticeable
- Positioned button absolutely to prevent layout conflicts
- Added proper z-index (99999) to ensure it's always on top
- Enhanced hover and active states for better feedback
- Added dark theme support for the close button

## How to Test

### 1. Test Before & After Photos
1. Log in as a salon owner
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Click on "Before & After Photos" section
4. You should either see:
   - "No Before/After Photos Yet" (if none uploaded)
   - Your uploaded photos (if any exist)
   - A specific error message if something goes wrong (e.g., "Failed to load photos (401)" for auth issues)

### 2. Test Videos
1. Log in as a salon owner (with Growth, Pro, or Elite plan)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Click on "My Videos" section
4. You should either see:
   - "No Videos Yet" (if none uploaded)
   - Your uploaded videos (if any exist)
   - A specific error message if something goes wrong

### 3. Test Toast Notification Close Button
1. Trigger any toast notification (e.g., try to favorite a salon)
2. A toast should appear in the bottom-right corner
3. Click the X button - it should:
   - Be clearly visible with a circular background
   - Close the toast immediately when clicked
   - Show hover effect when you hover over it
   - Work in both light and dark themes

## Expected Behavior

### Before & After Photos
- **Loading state:** Shows "Loading your before/after photos..."
- **Empty state:** Shows empty state with camera icon and upload prompt
- **With data:** Shows grid of comparison sliders with status badges
- **Error state:** Shows specific error message (e.g., "Failed to load photos (401)" or "Network error: Could not connect to server")

### Videos
- **Loading state:** Shows "Loading your videos..."
- **Empty state:** Shows empty state with video icon and upload prompt
- **With data:** Shows grid of videos with thumbnails and view counts
- **Error state:** Shows specific error message

### Toast Notifications
- **Appearance:** Smooth slide-in animation from right
- **Close button:** 28px circular button, visible background, positioned at top-right of toast
- **Hover:** Background darkens slightly, button scales up
- **Click:** Toast closes with smooth animation
- **Auto-close:** Still works after 5 seconds

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- **Before & After Photos:** `GET /api/before-after/my-photos`
- **Videos:** `GET /api/videos/my-videos`
- Both endpoints require authentication (JWT token in cookie)

### Database Models
```prisma
model BeforeAfterPhoto {
  id              String         @id @default(uuid())
  beforeImageUrl  String
  afterImageUrl   String
  caption         String?
  approvalStatus  ApprovalStatus @default(PENDING)
  salonId         String
  serviceId       String?
  // ... other fields
}

model ServiceVideo {
  id              String         @id @default(uuid())
  videoUrl        String
  vimeoId         String         @unique
  thumbnailUrl    String?
  duration        Int
  caption         String?
  approvalStatus  ApprovalStatus @default(PENDING)
  salonId         String
  serviceId       String?
  views           Int            @default(0)
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Failed to load photos/videos"
1. Check browser console for specific error codes
2. Verify you're logged in as a salon owner
3. Verify you have at least one salon created
4. Check backend logs for errors
5. Verify backend is running on port 5000
6. Verify frontend is running on port 3001

### If close button still not working
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for CSS errors
4. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

## Next Steps
1. Test uploading new before/after photos
2. Test uploading videos (requires Growth/Pro/Elite plan)
3. Verify approval workflow works for admin users
4. Test the public-facing display of approved photos/videos on salon pages
